### How It Works

1. **Install Extension:** Add OpenXrypt to your Chrome browser.
2. **Setup Keys:**
   - Add GPG (armored) public keys for your contacts.
   - Add GPG (armored) your own private key for decryption (recommend ECC-25519 bc size&speed)
3. **Encrypt & Decrypt:**
   - **Encrypt:** Select text in a direct message and click the "Encrypt" button in the popup.
   - **Decrypt:** Encrypted messages will be automatically decrypted and replaced with readable text.
