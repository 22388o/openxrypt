## OpenXrypt: Upgrade Your Social Media Privacy (Proof-of-Concept)

OpenXrypt is a Chrome extension designed to provide secure and encrypted communication on social media platforms, particularly on X (formerly known as Twitter). Utilizing OpenPGP encryption standards, OpenXrypt aims to help you protect your privacy and secure sensitive information.

### Features

- **Key Management:** Add, edit, and delete GPG public/private keys.
- **Multiple Key Encryption:** Encrypt messages for multiple recipients simultaneously.
- **Direct Message (DM) Compatibility:** Seamless integration with X (formerly Twitter) direct messaging.

### How It Works

1. **Install Extension:** Add OpenXrypt to your Chrome browser.
2. **Setup Keys:**
   - Add GPG (armored) public keys for your contacts.
   - Add GPG (armored) your own private key for decryption.
3. **Encrypt & Decrypt:**
   - **Encrypt:** Select text in a direct message and click the "Encrypt" button in the popup.
   - **Decrypt:** Encrypted messages will be automatically decrypted and replaced with readable text.
